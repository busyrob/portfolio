    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Pulse had become a catch-all.</p>

    <p>Over time, new features, announcements, and tools were layered onto the experience—each well-intentioned, but collectively overwhelming.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding"><strong>Associates struggled to:</strong></p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>find what mattered most</li>
      <li>informed without feeling flooded</li>
      <li>understand where to focus their attention</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The experience lacked hierarchy.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">The opportunity</h2>
    <p>The redesign wasn’t about adding more—it was about removing friction, clarifying priorities, and restoring focus.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">Pulse needed to:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>feel calm instead of crowded</li>
      <li>highlight what mattered now</li>
      <li>support both information and connection without competing for attention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This was also an opportunity to integrate Associate Assist in a way that felt natural—not bolted on.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">My role</h2>
    <p>I served as the design advisor and experience lead.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding"><strong>I was responsible for:</strong></p>
      <ul class="top-padding-0">
        <li>Guiding experience simplification and hierarchy</li>
        <li>Helping the team make difficult tradeoffs about what didn’t belong</li>
        <li>Shaping how AI capabilities were introduced into an existing platform</li>
        <li>Defending the work with stakeholders who had competing priorities</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The design team executed the work. My role was to ensure clarity, cohesion, and confidence in the direction.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Many stakeholders with competing needs</li>
      <li>A platform already in heavy daily use</li>
      <li>Strong attachment to existing features</li>
      <li>Needed to introduce new capabilities without disrupting trust</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="top-padding">Designing for focus</h2>
    
    <p>Rather than treating Pulse as a dashboard of everything, we reframed it as a place for orientation.</p>

    <p>The experience was organized around three core needs:</p>

    <p><strong>1. What do I need to know?</strong><br />
    News and updates were prioritized and editorialized—reducing noise while preserving relevance.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What do I need to do?</strong><br />
    Key tools and actions were surfaced clearly, without competing for attention.</p>

    <p>Associate Assist was introduced as a supportive layer—not the centerpiece—so it felt helpful rather than intrusive.</p>


    <p><strong>3. How do I stay connected?</strong><br />
    Events and social moments were redesigned to feel more human and engaging, without overwhelming the page.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Experience principles</h2>
    <p class="bottom-padding">The redesign was guided by a few simple principles:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Clear hierarchy over equal weight</li>
      <li>Less, but better</li>
      <li>Calm first impressions</li>
      <li>Familiar, not flashy</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These principles helped the team navigate tough decisions when everything felt important.</p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>The redesigned Pulse experience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced cognitive overload</li>
      <li>Made key information easier to find</li>
      <li>Created space for new capabilities without clutter</li>
      <li>Felt calmer and more intentional for everyday use</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>It also established a framework for future updates—so the platform could evolve without becoming noisy again.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Why this mattered</h2>

    <p>Pulse is a daily touchpoint for associates. Improving clarity here had an outsized impact—not just on usability, but on how people felt starting their day.</p>

    <p>This work demonstrated that focus and restraint can be just as transformative as new features.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Reflection</h2>

    <p>This project reinforced that design leadership is often about subtraction.</p>

    <p>My impact came from helping the team and stakeholders agree on what mattered most—and having the conviction to protect that focus.</p>
