    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Associates needed information from dozens of internal tools—but accessing it required knowing where that information lived.</p>

    <p>Even simple questions—like policy details, operational status, or process guidance—often required switching between systems, searching documentation, or asking around.</p>

    <p>The result was friction, wasted time, and inconsistent answers.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">The opportunity</h2>
    <p>Rather than improving individual tools in isolation, the opportunity was to <strong>remove the burden of navigation altogether.</strong></p>

    <p>If associates could simply ask a question and get a reliable answer, the system complexity could disappear behind the experience.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">The goal wasn’t to replace tools—it was to <strong>orchestrate them.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">My role</h2>
    <p>I served as the design advisor and experience lead.</p>

    <p><strong>I was responsible for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Defining the experience vision for a conversational interface</li>
        <li>Shaping how multiple systems would feel like a single product</li>
        <li>Guiding designers through interaction patterns and tradeoffs</li>
        <li>Helping align product, design, and leadership around a clear narrative</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The design team executed the work. My role was to ensure the experience felt intentional, trustworthy, and scalable.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>13 independent systems with different data models and behaviors</li>
      <li>Early-stage internal AI platform</li>
      <li>High expectations around accuracy and trust</li>
      <li><strong>Needed to feel useful immediately—not experimental</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="top-padding">Designing a single place for answers</h2>
    
    <p>The core challenge wasn’t AI—it was experience coherence.</p>

    <p>We focused on three principles:</p>

    <p><strong>1. You shouldn’t need to know where information lives</strong><br />
    Associates shouldn’t have to understand internal system boundaries to get answers.</p>

    <p>The experience needed to feel like:<br />
    <em>“Ask once, get what you need.”</em></p>

    <p><strong>2. Answers must feel confident, not probabilistic</strong><br />
    In an enterprise context, uncertainty erodes trust quickly.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">We emphasized:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Clear sourcing</li>
      <li>Direct language</li>
      <li>Predictable response patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The goal was confidence over cleverness.</p>

    <p><strong>3. The system should reduce cognitive load, not add to it</strong><br />
    Conversational AI can overwhelm users if it’s verbose or unfocused.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">We prioritized:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Concise responses</li>
      <li>Structured follow-ups</li>
      <li>Clear next steps when more detail was needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h6 class="top-padding">These principles guided how we framed the system and interaction model.</h6>

    <h5>Rather than positioning Associate Assist as “AI,” we framed it as a new way of working.</h5>

    <h5>One place.<br />
    One interaction model.<br />
    One mental model.</h5>

    <h5>This framing helped leadership and stakeholders see the value not as novelty—but as infrastructure.</h5>
    
    <h2 class="top-padding-40">Why this mattered</h2>
    <p><strong>Associate Assist</strong> wasn’t just a product—it established a new interaction pattern for internal tools.</p>

    <p>It demonstrated how AI could reduce friction without increasing cognitive load, and helped set expectations for how future internal experiences should feel.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Outcome</h2>
    <p>Associate Assist connected 13 of the most-used internal applications into a single conversational experience.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">It:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Reduced friction for everyday questions</li>
      <li>Eliminated the need to know where information lived</li>
      <li>Established a foundation for future AI-driven experiences</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The work also became a catalyst—later informing how AI capabilities were integrated into other internal platforms, including Pulse.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project reinforced that the hardest part of AI-enabled products isn’t intelligence—it’s trust and clarity.</p>

    <p>My impact came from helping teams design an experience that felt simple, reliable, and human, despite the complexity underneath.</p>
