    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>The pharmacy landing page had become read-only and fragmented.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">Members were forced to:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>navigate page-to-page to take common actions</li>
      <li>interpret dense, duplicative content</li>
      <li>guess where to go for refills, renewals, or order status</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While the business asked for “simplification,” what existed was already simple on the surface—but inefficient in practice.</p>


    <h2 class="top-padding">The task</h2>
    <p class="bottom-padding">Our mandate was clear:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Simplify the pharmacy landing page</li>
      <li>Streamline or remove duplicative functionality</li>
      <li>Create intuitive entry points for common actions</li>
      <li>Reduce the experience to the top reasons members come to Pharmacy</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The assumption was that fewer options would automatically lead to better outcomes.</strong></p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">My opportunity</h2>
    <p>As we explored the problem, it became clear that removing functionality wasn’t the answer.</p>

    <p>Members didn’t just need a simpler page—they needed a page that could adapt to them.</p>

    <p>The real opportunity was to turn the pharmacy landing page into a working surface, not a signpost.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">My role</h2>
    <p>I served as the design advisor and experience lead.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding"><strong>I was responsible for:</strong></p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Challenging the assumption that simplification meant reduction</li>
      <li>Guiding the experience toward progressive disclosure</li>
      <li>Helping the team design a landing page that scaled with user need</li>
      <li>Defending a counterintuitive approach with stakeholders</li>
      <li>Supporting designers through critique, iteration, and testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The design team executed the work. My role was to ensure clarity, confidence, and long-term viability of the solution.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Constraints</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Regulated healthcare environment</li>
      <li>Wide range of member familiarity and comfort with technology</li>
      <li>Strong focus on older populations</li>
      <li>Business pressure to “simplify” quickly</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="top-padding">Designing a page that grows with the member</h2>
    
    <p>Instead of reducing the page to a static set of tiles or links, we designed the pharmacy home to <strong>expand based on relevance.</strong></p>

    <p>This approach was initially counterintuitive—but testing validated it decisively…</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding"><strong>1. Turn the landing page into a tool</strong><br />
We enabled members to:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>renew</li>
      <li>refill</li>
      <li>search for medications directly from the landing page.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This eliminated unnecessary navigation and guesswork.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding"><strong>2. Let content scale with need</strong></p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Members with no prescriptions saw educational and marketing content</li>
      <li>Members with active prescriptions saw actionable tools immediately</li>
      <li>The more medications a member had, the more the page revealed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The experience grew—not cluttered.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Reduce guessing through clarity</strong><br />
    Order status, pricing context, and actions were made visible and predictable.</p>

    <p>Members no longer had to infer where information lived—the page made it obvious.</p>

    <p><strong>Testing & validation</strong><br />
    While the approach initially raised concerns, testing revealed strong results—particularly well with older members—the group stakeholders were most concerned about.</p>

    <p class="bottom-padding">The expandable, task-first model:</p>
    <ul class="top-padding-0">
      <li>Reduced confusion</li>
      <li>Increased confidence</li>
      <li>Allowed members to act immediately without navigating away</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This validation was critical in building trust around the direction.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">Before & After</h2>
    <p><strong>Before:</strong><br /> A read-only, fragmented landing page that pushed members elsewhere to act.</p>

    <p><strong>After:</strong><br /> A dynamic pharmacy home that supported action, learning, and growth in one place.</p>

    <hr />

    <h6 class="bottom-padding-80">The goal wasn’t to make the page smaller—it was to make it smarter.</h6>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>The redesigned Pharmacy Home:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced clutter without removing capability</li>
      <li>Enabled common tasks directly on the landing page</li>
      <li>Scaled naturally with member complexity</li>
      <li>Performed particularly well with older users</li>
      <li>Created a foundation that could evolve without redesigning from scratch</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2 class="top-padding">Why this mattered</h2>

    <p>Pulse is a daily touchpoint for associates. Improving clarity here had an outsized impact—not just on usability, but on how people felt starting their day.</p>

    <p>This work demonstrated that focus and restraint can be just as transformative as new features.</p>

    <h2 class="top-padding">What this changed</h2>

    <p>This project reinforced that <strong>simplicity is not about fewer options</strong>—it’s about fewer decisions.</p>

    <p>My impact came from recognizing when a problem required restraint—and when it required conviction to push against an assumption that felt safe, but wasn’t correct.</p>
