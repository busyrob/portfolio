    <h2>The problem</h2>
    <p>Employers and brokers had limited visibility into how their employees were actually using the services they were paying for.</p>

    <p>Data existed, but it wasn’t actionable. Trends, risks, and successes were buried in reports that required interpretation—slowing decision-making.</p>

    <p>The opportunity wasn’t to show more data, but to surface what mattered—clearly, quickly, and with confidence.</p>

    <h2>My role</h2>
    <p>I served as the design advisor and experience lead—responsible for framing the problem, setting experience direction, guiding conceptual design, and shaping the narrative presented to leadership.</p>

    <p>The design team executed the work. My role was to ensure clarity, confidence, and alignment at every step.</p>

    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Two-week conceptual timeline</li>
      <li>High executive visibility</li>
      <li>No appetite for speculative or exploratory work</li>
      <li><strong>Needed to feel credible enough to invest in immediately</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Designing for decision-making</h2>
    <p>Rather than designing a dense analytics dashboard, we focused on decision clarity.</p>

    <p><strong>We asked:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>What should someone understand in 30 seconds?</li>
      <li>Which patterns matter more than raw numbers?</li>
      <li>How do we surface risk without creating alarm?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The experience prioritized:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Signals over noise</li>
        <li>Trends over snapshots</li>
        <li>Plain-language framing over technical labels</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>The concept resonated immediately with leadership.</p>

    <p>What began as a two-week conceptual effort was fast-tracked into development—based on the clarity of the story and confidence in the direction.</p>

    <p>The project validated the premise that strong framing and narrative can accelerate product decisions as much as execution.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project reinforced the importance of designing for understanding—not just functionality—especially when time and trust are limited.</p>

    <p>My impact came not from execution, but from helping the team and stakeholders see the problem clearly enough to act.</p>
